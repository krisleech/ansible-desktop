dconf settings

org.mate.background.show-desktop-icons false
org.mate.background.draw-background false
org.mate.session.required-components.windowmanger i3
org.mate.session.required-components.panel ''  <- if you dont want top panels (they are pointless)

All tasks which try and install software not in Debain need fixing, e.g. rofi.

Consider backports for some software to get newer versions.
